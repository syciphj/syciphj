### Hey there, Henri here. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Team Leader and frontend developer who loves crafting delightful experiences on web and mobile. Back in 2014 I switched from brand management to software development. Since then, I've designed and developed web applications and pioneered a support engineering team in APAC. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: an e-commerce sample with Svelte

ðŸŒ± My latest project: [https://github.com/syciphj/hs-portfolio](https://github.com/syciphj/hs-portfolio)  - personal website
